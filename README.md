# Bob_the_assistant
This is the beginnings of my own attempt at a GPT based assistant
Bob is designed to take in everything i say and hear everyday. He listens for his name and when he hears it takes what text follows as his prompt for the OpenAI chatGPT completion engine. 
Otherwise an ongoing transcript is kept of everyday. Once a day analysis is run on the transcript. Once a week that is collated and once a month used to finetune a new model of bob based on my voice and text interactions with ppl online. 
Over time i want to use this to keep track of changes in my opinions, views, and realistically to begin the process of training what could be a digital alter ego.
